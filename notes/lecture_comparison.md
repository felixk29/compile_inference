universal,

tries to improve for variational inference with stochastic support

Gen paper, maybe? idk 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10872.pdf  
guest lecture, tries to combine logic, probabilisitc programming and neural networks, inclusion of neural is interesting maybe? 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12574.pdf  
swedish, also deep, 

https://dl-acm-org.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3192366.3192399
actually references ours, triest to improve performance, but not deep

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239.pdf
uses neural, but wildly different goal, maybe as a juxtaposition? 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07706.pdf
universal, neural, checkpot

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06249.pdf
Same thing as our paper, but focus on baysian stuff, context free grammar, 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05735.pdf
also tries to improve inference with deep, same thing slightly worse,
