## Probabilistic Programming Notes for proposal
 1. Description of topic  
    Describe the paper and stuff   
 2. Literature study  
    at least 5 relevant papers are discussed, connection is explained, explain their strength/weakness in comparison to main paper,  
 3. Relation to other topics in the course   
    topic is correclty related and go beyond class information
 4. Experimental test  
    Problem is correclry modelled, all choices motivated, provided code works,  
 5. Research proposal  
    Strength/weakness based on code, compared to literature, beyond things straight up mentioned, all chosen research questions are motivated, direction of research is motivated and based on correct assumptions, alternatives are considered and failure cases anticipated, evaluation criteriums for success/failure of experiments are defined and motivated, 


Questions for Teacher:
 - Is rubrik max adjusted for 2 people?
